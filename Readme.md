#Look-and-say SequenceThis is a small application that can generate a [look-and-say-sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Look-and-say_sequence). It is a sequence of numbers where the pronounciation of the numbers is actually determining the next sequence.Originally written to help generate sequences for a set of riddles found somewhere online, it needs conversion from characters and integers which was a nice puzzle in itself.
